    <h1 class="ba">THIS IS BALEVANI FLASH-CARD AND HERE ARE THE THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT JAVASCRIPT.</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <ul id="card-list1" class="design1"><b>Javascript</b>
        <li class="card-text1">JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content,
            control
            multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what
            you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
        </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn1">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list2" class="design2"><b>Operators</b>
        <li class="card-text2">Operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more. There are
            different types of JavaScript operators: Arithmetic Operators. Assignment Operators. Comparison Operators.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn2">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list3" class="design3"><b>Variables</b>
        <li class="card-text3">Variables are containers for storing information. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a
            variable: var carName; After the declaration, the variable is empty (it has no value)
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn3">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list4" class="design4"><b>Variable naming conventions</b>
        <li class="card-text4">Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore ( _ ) or a dollar sign ( $ ). Variable names cannot
            contain spaces. Variables cannot be the same as reserved keywords such as if or const . By convention,
            JavaScript variable names are written in camelCase.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn4">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list5" class="design5"><b>Functions</b>
        <li class="card-text5"> functions are first-class objects, because they can be passed to other functions, returned from functions,
            and assigned to variables and properties.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn5">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list6" class="design6"><b>Methods</b>
        <li class="card-text6"> JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property
            containing a function definition.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn6">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list7" class="design7"><b>Arguments</b>
        <li class="card-text7"> arguments is an array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments
            passed to that function.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn7" >click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list8" class="design8"><b>Parameters</b>
        <li class="card-text8">Parameters are essentially passed to functions by value — so if the code within the body of a function
            assigns a completely new value to a parameter that was passed to the function, the change is not reflected
            globally or in the code which called that function.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn8">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list9" class="design9"><b>Returns</b>
        <li class="card-text9">JavaScript return statement is used to return a particular value from the function. The function will stop
            the execution when the return statement is called and return a specific value. The return statement should
            be the last statement of the function because the code after the return statement won't be accessible.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn9">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list10" class="design10"><b>Chaining Methods</b>
        <li class="card-text10">What is Method chaining? It is a programming strategy that simplifies and embellishes your code. It is a
            mechanism for calling a method on another method of the same object. JavaScript this keyword refers to the
            current object in which it is called.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn10">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list11" class="design11"><b>Strings</b>
        <li class="card-text11">A JavaScript string stores a series of characters like "John Doe". A string can be any text inside double or
            single quotes.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn11">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list12" class="design12"><b>Boolean</b>
        <li class="card-text12">In JavaScript, a boolean value is one that can either be TRUE or FALSE. If you need to know “yes” or “no”
            about something, then you would want to use the boolean function. It sounds extremely simple, but booleans
            are used all the time in JavaScript programming, and they are extremely useful.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn12">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list13" class="design13"><b>Undefined</b>
        <li class="card-text13">A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns
            undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
            undefined if a value was not returned.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn13">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list14" class="design14"><b>NaN</b>
        <li class="card-text14">In JavaScript, NaN is short for "Not-a-Number". In JavaScript, NaN is a number that is not a legal number.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn14">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list15" class="design15"><b>Null</b>
        <li class="card-text15">In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents an empty or unknown value. For example, let number =
            null; The code above suggests that the number variable is empty at the moment and may have a value later.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn15">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list16" class="design16"><b>Alert</b>
        <li class="card-text16">One useful function that's native to JavaScript is the alert() function. This function will display text in
            a dialog box that pops up on the screen. Before this function can work, we must first call the showAlert()
            function. JavaScript functions are called in response to events.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn16">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list17" class="design17"><b>Comments</b>
        <li class="card-text17">JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable. JavaScript
            comments can also be used to prevent execution.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn17">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list18" class="design18"><b>Jquery</b>
        <li class="card-text18">jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal
            and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across
            a multitude of browsers.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn18">click here</button>
        <br><br>
        <ul id="card-list19" class="design19"><b>Attributes</b>
        <li class="card-text19"> a collection of objects that belong to a built-in Attr class, with name and value properties.
        </li>
    </ul>
        <button class="btn btn-success" id="btn19">click here</button>
